# Thinking & Reasoning

## Clarify terms (definitions; scope; assumptions)
- Example: Before arguing "AI is safe," define "AI," "safe," the time horizon, and the threat model.

## Models of truth (correspondence; coherence; pragmatism)
- Example: A model can be internally coherent yet not correspond to reality; in product, "works for users" is pragmatic truth.

## Probabilistic thinking (Bayes; calibration; base rates)
- Example: If a startup pitch sounds amazing, start from the base rate of venture outcomes, then update with evidence.

## Causal reasoning (mechanisms; confounders; counterfactuals)
- Example: "Remote work reduced output" might be confounded by layoffs; test counterfactuals (teams without layoffs).

## Counterfactual thinking (alternative histories; decision vs outcome)
- Example: A trade made money; ask how often the same decision would lose under slightly different paths.
- Use: Judge decisions by a distribution of possible outcomes, not the single realized outcome.
- Tool: Write 2–3 plausible alternative histories ("what else could have happened?") before concluding causality.
- Tie-in: Pairs naturally with Monte Carlo simulation and expected value thinking.

## Systems thinking (feedback loops; delays; second-order effects)
- Example: Incentivizing fast code reviews increases speed short-term but may create a long-term quality debt loop.
