# Problem Solving (Process)
## Frame the problem (goal; constraints; success metrics)
- Example: "Improve onboarding" becomes "reduce time-to-first-success from 30 min to 10 min without increasing support tickets."

## Decompose (subproblems; interfaces; bottlenecks)
- Example: "Build search" splits into indexing, ranking, query UX, latency budget, and evaluation metrics.

## Generate options (divergent then convergent)
- Example: Write 10 approaches (including "do nothing"), then pick 2 to prototype rather than debating in the abstract.

## Evaluate (expected value; risks; reversibility)
- Example: Prefer reversible experiments for uncertain bets; reserve one-way decisions for high-conviction cases.

## Execute (plan; checkpoints; feedback)
- Example: Use a 1-week milestone with a measurable artifact (demo, benchmark, user test) to force reality contact.

## Learn (postmortem; update beliefs; document)
- Example: After an incident, capture "what we believed" vs "what happened" and update the runbook and assumptions.
