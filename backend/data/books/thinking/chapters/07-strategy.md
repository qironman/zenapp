# Strategy (Power & Competition)

## Bottleneck capture (own the scarce input)
- Example: Control a chokepoint everyone needs (GPUs, shipping lanes, key distribution); scarcity turns operations into power.

## Platform moat (ecosystem lock-in)
- Example (NVIDIA): CUDA + libraries + tooling create switching costs; "the platform" pulls hardware demand, not just the other way around.

## Escape competition (monopoly rents via moats)
- Example: In near-perfect competition, profits get competed away;
  durable outperformance requires some "unfair" advantage that rivals can't copy quickly.
- Meaning (practical): "Monopoly" here usually means differentiation + defensibility,
  not literally being the only seller and not necessarily an illegal monopoly.
- Mechanisms: proprietary tech, network effects, economies of scale,
  switching costs, brand/trust, distribution control.
- Competition framing: aim to win a category by making it small and owned (niche -> expand),
  rather than entering a red-ocean where prices get bid down.
- Failure mode: ignoring substitutes ("people can do it another way") and entry ("new players can copy").
- Model pointers:
  - ### Commodity treadmill (moat must be operational)
  - ### Platform moat (ecosystem lock-in)
  - ### Bottleneck capture (own the scarce input)
  - ### Complementor flywheel (make others successful)

## Full-stack integration (sell the system, not the part)
- Example (NVIDIA): Performance comes from the whole stack (GPU + interconnect + networking + software); selling an integrated system reduces buyer risk and speeds adoption.

## Complementor flywheel (make others successful)
- Example (NVIDIA): Invest in SDKs, kernels, and partnerships so researchers and startups build on your stack; their success increases your demand.

## Real options / asset reusability (buy flexibility; exercise later)
- Example: Build capabilities that can be redeployed when the regime changes (military platforms, political coalitions, or GPU fleets).

## Cycle surfing (adjacent pivot)
- Example: Keep the core capability, switch the arena (crypto -> AI; campaign issue A -> issue B; defense doctrine -> new threat).

## Capital structure as strategy (financing is part of the product)
- Example: If resources are the bottleneck, funding mechanisms (alliances, taxation, debt, pre-commit contracts) can decide who scales.

## Specialization wedge vs hyperscalers (be narrowly excellent)
- Example: Beat giants by being the best at one mission (elite unit, single-issue party, or one workload class) instead of trying to do everything.

## Pick-and-shovel (second-order bet)
- Example: Provide infrastructure to many contenders (compute, rails, media distribution) rather than picking one winner to back.

## Customer-concentration trade (scale now; risk later)
- Example: One anchor patron/ally/customer can unlock scale, but they gain leverage over you (pricing, policy, terms).

## Commodity treadmill (moat must be operational)
- Example: When the "thing" becomes cheaper and common, advantage shifts to speed, reliability, supply access, and coordination.

## Ends-Ways-Means (align objectives, approach, resources)
- Example: If the end is "win the election," the ways might be "mobilize turnout," and the means are "field staff + budget + message discipline."

## OODA loop (observe, orient, decide, act)
- Example: A campaign that reacts daily to opponent moves can out-tempo a slower organization, even with fewer resources.

## Center of gravity (what holds the system together)
- Example: In war it might be logistics or leadership; in business it might be distribution or a key customer; protect yours and attack theirs.

## Deterrence vs compellence (prevent vs force)
- Example: Deterrence: make an attack/entry too costly; compellence: force a change in behavior via credible pressure.

## Escalation ladders (control the level of conflict)
- Example: In geopolitics and pricing wars, leave off-ramps; don't escalate to a level you can't sustain or win.

## Covering (defensive shadowing; protect the lead)
- Example: In sail racing, if you're ahead, "cover" the boat behind by matching their tack/line
  so they can't take a different wind lane and pass you.
- Core idea: When you lead, optimize probability of winning (variance control), not maximum speed.
- How: identify the nearest threat; stay between them and the mark/finish; keep a "loose cover"
  so you can respond without sailing their dirty air.
- When it works: late in the race; clear primary threat; limited remaining opportunities for big regime shifts.
- When to break cover: if a major wind/current shift is developing and covering would drag you into a losing lane.
- Failure modes: over-fixating on #2 while #3 makes a big move; copying into bad conditions; giving up too much speed.
- Model pointers:
  - ### Game theory (strategies; equilibria; commitment)
  - ### OODA loop (observe, orient, decide, act)
  - ### Second-order thinking (downstream consequences)

## Come-from-behind strategy (increase variance; force dilemmas)
- Example: If the leader is "covering" you, you can’t win by mirroring; you need a move that creates separation.
- Core idea: When behind, optimize probability of overtaking, not average performance.
- Separation: change arena (segment/channel/tech), take a different lane (strategy), or create a new axis of competition.
- Regime shifts: time your move around discontinuities (platform changes, policy shifts, cycles, standards).
- Asymmetric bets: pick options with limited downside and large upside (optionality).
- Force tradeoffs: create situations where defending you is costly (cover vs speed), or where the leader must split attention.
- Leverage points: focus on chokepoints where small gains flip outcomes (distribution, key accounts, hiring, partnerships).
- Avoid ruin: take higher variance, but don’t take “game over” risk unless you have no other chance.
- Model pointers:
  - ### Covering (defensive shadowing; protect the lead)
  - ### Optionality and reversibility (one-way vs two-way doors)
  - ### OODA loop (observe, orient, decide, act)
  - ### Bottleneck capture (own the scarce input)
  - ### Escalation ladders (control the level of conflict)

## Alliance and coalition strategy (borrow strength)
- Example: Build coalitions where each member gains: states align interests, parties trade support, companies partner to reach distribution.

## Legitimacy and narrative (power that people accept)
- Example: A policy/campaign succeeds when it has a story that feels fair; a company strategy sticks when stakeholders buy the why.

## Intelligence and reconnaissance (reduce uncertainty)
- Example: Before committing, invest in discovery: polling and field intel, customer interviews, adversary capability mapping.

## Deception and surprise (shape opponent beliefs)
- Example: Feints in war; stealth launches in business; message discipline in politics to delay opponent response.

## Logistics and sustainment (what you can keep doing)
- Example: Winning is often about endurance: supply lines, cash runway, hiring pipeline, and operational resilience.

## Maneuver vs attrition (positioning vs grinding)
- Example: Maneuver: change the game (new market/coalition); attrition: outspend/outlast. Choose based on relative advantages.

## Asymmetric strategy (win where the opponent is weak)
- Example: A smaller actor avoids head-on fights and targets vulnerabilities: niche segments, procedural choke points, or unconventional tactics.

## Credible commitments and signaling (make promises believable)
- Example: To change behavior, signals must be costly or binding (treaties, contracts, public pledges, irreversible investments).

## Incrementalism / salami slicing (small moves that add up)
- Example: When big moves trigger backlash, advance by many small steps that each look tolerable in isolation.
