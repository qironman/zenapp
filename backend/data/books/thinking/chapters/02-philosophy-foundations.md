# Philosophy (Foundations)

## Epistemology (what counts as knowledge)
- Example: In a debate, separate "I saw it" (observation) vs "I heard it" (testimony) vs "it seems plausible" (inference).

## Logic (valid inference; fallacies)
- Example: "All successful founders are intense; therefore be intense to succeed" is affirming the consequent (selection effect + fallacy).

## Metaphysics (what exists; causation; time)
- Example: When you say "stress causes burnout," ask what "cause" means (trigger vs contributor vs necessary condition).

## Ethics (how to act; values; tradeoffs)
- Example: "Should we ship this feature?" may be a values question (harm, consent, fairness), not just a revenue question.

## Philosophy of mind (consciousness; identity; agency)
- Example: When you're procrastinating, treat "you" as multiple subagents (planner vs doer) and design incentives accordingly.
