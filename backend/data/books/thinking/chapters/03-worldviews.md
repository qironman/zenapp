# Worldviews (Religion & Quantum Physics)

## Comparison axes (rubric for worldview claims)
- Example: When comparing traditions, map each claim to an axis (what is real, how you know, what to do).
- Ontology: What is ultimately real? What is the "self"?
- Epistemology: What counts as knowledge (revelation, reason, meditation, experiment)?
- Causality: Determinism, karma, providence, chance, constraints.
- Time: Linear, cyclical, illusory, emergent.
- Cosmology: Origin and structure of worlds (one cosmos, many worlds, cycles, creators).
- Suffering/evil: Diagnosis of the problem; why things go wrong.
- Liberation/salvation: What "success" looks like (awakening, harmony, heaven).
- Practice: What you do (ethics, ritual, contemplation) and why it works.
- Scope note: Quantum physics constrains physical claims; religions also make ethical and metaphysical claims.

## Genesis / origin questions (why is there anything?)
- Example: Two people can agree on the same observations,
  and still disagree on "ultimate origin" (first cause, cycles, brute fact).
- Clarify the target: origin of our local universe, origin of physical law, origin of existence, origin of meaning.
- Explanation types: mechanism (how), reason (why), story (how to live), and constraint (what must be true).
- Underdetermination: many metaphysical stories fit the same empirical data; prefer humility and explicit priors.
- Model pointers:
  - ### Models of truth (correspondence; coherence; pragmatism)
  - ### Metaphysics (what exists; causation; time)
  - ### Map vs territory (models are not reality)

## Simulation hypothesis (computational metaphysics)
- Example: Elon Musk has argued publicly that it is likely we live in a simulation (popular framing).
- Claim variants: "literally simulated physics" vs "informational ontology" vs "VR as metaphor for perception."
- Argument sketch (informal): if advanced civilizations run many ancestor-sims, a random observer might be in one.
- Related line of thought: "digital physics" / information-first framings treat computation/information
  as more fundamental than matter (speculative; overlaps simulation intuitions).
- Epistemic status: mostly non-falsifiable with current tools; treat as a prior/interpretation, not a scientific result.
- Failure modes: importing "simulation" as a total explanation (it pushes the question back: who runs it, and why?).
- Practice hook: even if true, daily ethics and suffering still have local reality at the level you experience.
- Model pointers:
  - ### Probabilistic thinking (Bayes; calibration; base rates)
  - ### Clarify terms (definitions; scope; assumptions)
  - ### Map vs territory (models are not reality)

## Buddhist cosmology: many worlds (cosmology vs soteriology)
- Example: Many Buddhist traditions describe vast numbers of world-systems,
  and cycles of arising/ceasing (details vary by school).
- Separation: cosmology is not the core proof; the core is dukkha diagnosis + path/practice.
- Time/cosmos: cyclic cosmologies can coexist with "moment-to-moment" dependent origination in practice.
- Reading modes: literal, symbolic, psychological, and pedagogical ("skillful means") interpretations can coexist.
- Comparison to simulation talk: both can de-center the human viewpoint.
  Buddhism ties this directly to reducing clinging.
- Model pointers:
  - ### Models of truth (correspondence; coherence; pragmatism)
  - ### Epistemology (what counts as knowledge)
  - ### Clarify terms (definitions; scope; assumptions)

## Buddhism and the "multiverse" analogy (useful, limited)
- Example: "Many worlds" in Buddhism can rhyme with "multiverse" language,
  but the match depends on which multiverse you mean.
- Physics meanings (not one thing):
  - Many-Worlds interpretation: one quantum state, many branches (interpretation of QM).
  - Inflation/landscape ideas: many causally separated regions with different conditions (speculative).
- Buddhist meaning (broad): many world-systems / realms over vast timescales,
  embedded in an ethical-soteriological framework (karma, liberation).
- Useful resonance: de-centers "my world is the whole story"; weakens ego-centric intuitions.
- Key mismatch: physics multiverse is about physical histories and predictions;
  Buddhist cosmology is usually in service of practice and liberation.
- Safe stance: treat the analogy as an intuition pump, not a proof in either direction.
- Model pointers:
  - ### Translation layer (compare without category errors)
  - ### Map vs territory (models are not reality)
  - ### Epistemology (what counts as knowledge)

## Buddhism: core path (dukkha; anatta; dependent origination)
- Example: Four Noble Truths; Eightfold Path; meditation (samadhi) + insight (vipassana).
- Ontology: No permanent, independent self (anatta); phenomena as conditioned and impermanent (anicca).
- Causality: Dependent origination; karma as moral causation (varies by tradition and interpretation).
- Epistemology: Direct insight via practice; supported by teacher lineages and texts.
- Suffering: Dukkha arises from craving/aversion and mistaking impermanent phenomena for stable identities.
- Modern bridge (careful): some evo-psych/cog-sci framings treat perception and "self"
  as constructed for function, not literal truth.
- Desire treadmill: satisfaction often decays after attainment (hedonic adaptation),
  which rhymes with the diagnosis of craving-driven dukkha.
- Practice claim: mindfulness trains observing thoughts/feelings without immediately identifying or acting.
- Liberation: Nirvana as cessation of clinging and ignorance; compassion is central in many schools.
- Comparison to QM (careful): Both challenge naive "solid object" intuitions; QM is not a soteriology.

## Daoism (Dao; wu-wei; ziran)
- Example: Wu-wei (effortless action); living in accord with nature; "soft power" (water metaphor).
- Ontology: The Dao as the generative source/process; reality as dynamic flow rather than fixed essences.
- Epistemology: Knowing by attunement and practice; skepticism toward rigid conceptual carving.
- Causality: Emphasis on indirect causation and harmony; shape conditions instead of forcing outcomes.
- Time: Cycles and seasons; change as fundamental; "return" as a pattern.
- Ethics: Virtue (de) as natural expression; simplicity; minimal coercion.
- Comparison to QM (careful): Resonances are mostly at the "process over objects" level; QM does not imply harmony.

## Hinduism (dharma; karma; moksha; diverse metaphysics)
- Example: Bhakti (devotion), jnana (knowledge), yoga (discipline), ritual and temple practice.
- Ontology: Varies widely (dualistic theism to non-dualism); terms like atman/brahman mean different things by school.
- Epistemology: Scripture + reason + practice/realization; authority differs across traditions.
- Causality: Karma and samsara; dharma as order/duty; liberation framed as moksha.
- Comparison to QM (careful): Non-dual metaphysics is not testable physics; avoid "QM proves Vedanta" stories.

## Christianity (creation; incarnation; salvation)
- Example: Jesus' teachings; prayer; sacraments; love of neighbor; community and service.
- Ontology: Creator/creation distinction; personal God; humans as moral agents.
- Epistemology: Revelation + tradition + reason; historical claims are central for many denominations.
- Causality: Providence; debates over free will, grace, and predestination.
- Liberation: Salvation/union with God; redemption of persons and (in some views) creation.
- Comparison to QM (careful): QM does not adjudicate theological claims.
  It updates the physical picture at small scales.

## Islam (tawhid; prophecy; submission)
- Example: Five Pillars; Qur'an recitation; daily prayer; zakat; fasting.
- Ontology: Radical monotheism (tawhid); created order; moral accountability.
- Epistemology: Revelation (Qur'an) + prophetic example (Sunnah) + jurisprudential reasoning.
- Causality: Divine will with human responsibility; theology varies across schools (TODO: expand carefully if needed).
- Liberation: Right relationship with God; justice and mercy; afterlife.
- Comparison to QM (careful): Physics constrains physical claims, not revelation or jurisprudence.

## Judaism (covenant; law; peoplehood)
- Example: Torah study; mitzvot; Shabbat; communal and family life.
- Ontology: One God; covenantal history; sanctification of ordinary life.
- Epistemology: Text + commentary + legal reasoning + lived practice.
- Time: Strong linear-historical orientation; memory and obligation shape identity.
- Comparison to QM (careful): Don't treat indeterminacy as evidence for miracles or providence.

## Quantum physics (core constraints; interpretation space)
- Example: Double-slit interference; quantized energy levels; entanglement correlations.
- Ontology (minimal): Systems are represented by quantum states; outcomes are probabilistic (Born rule).
- Epistemology: Models are judged by predictive accuracy under clear measurement procedures.
- Causality: Unitary evolution vs measurement update; tension known as the measurement problem.
- Nonlocality (precise): Entanglement yields correlations that violate Bell inequalities without enabling FTL signaling.
- Interpretations (options): Copenhagen-family, Many-Worlds, Bohmian mechanics, objective collapse, QBism.
- Worldview caution: QM is about physical regularities; it does not itself supply meaning, ethics, or salvation.

## Scientific cosmology (Big Bang model; early-universe limits)
- Example: The Big Bang model describes an expanding universe from a hot, dense early state.
  It is not automatically a story of "creation from nothing."
- What it explains well: large-scale expansion, background radiation, element abundances (as a model family).
- Where it gets speculative: earliest moments, quantum gravity, "before" (if that notion is even well-defined).
- Bridge to worldviews: physics constrains physical histories; metaphysics fills the "why existence?" gap.

## Translation layer (compare without category errors)
- Example: Treat religion as a package (metaphysics + ethics + practice + community), and QM as a physical model class.
- Ask: Is the claim about observable predictions, or about lived experience and norms?
- Keep analogies one-way: use QM to loosen intuition, not to "prove" metaphysical doctrines.
- Model pointers:
  - ### Epistemology (what counts as knowledge)
  - ### Metaphysics (what exists; causation; time)
  - ### Map vs territory (models are not reality)
  - ### Clarify terms (definitions; scope; assumptions)

## Quantum-mysticism failure modes (common traps)
- Example: "Observer" in QM often means measurement interaction, not "human consciousness" by default.
- Equivocation: swapping "uncertainty" (technical) with "anything is possible" (narrative).
- Terminology collision: "many worlds" (Buddhist cosmology) is not "Many-Worlds" (QM interpretation).
- Overfitting: cherry-picking QM buzzwords to backfill spiritual conclusions.
- Category error: using physics to decide ethics or liberation.
