# Case Studies

## CoreWeave (crypto mining -> GPU cloud -> AI boom)
- Example: A GPU-heavy crypto-mining origin can pivot into AI/HPC by reusing the same core capability (running and financing GPU fleets) when the demand regime changes.
- History (very brief):
  Started as a GPU crypto-mining operation.
  Pivoted into a specialized GPU cloud as AI demand (and GPU scarcity) surged.
  Scaled rapidly via heavy capex + financing + anchor customers, becoming a notable AI infrastructure provider.
- Model pointers:
  Strategy (Power & Competition):
  - ### Bottleneck capture (own the scarce input)
  - ### Real options / asset reusability (buy flexibility; exercise later)
  - ### Cycle surfing (adjacent pivot)
  - ### Capital structure as strategy (financing is part of the product)
  - ### Specialization wedge vs hyperscalers (be narrowly excellent)
  - ### Pick-and-shovel (second-order bet)
  - ### Customer-concentration trade (scale now; risk later)
  - ### Commodity treadmill (moat must be operational)
  Common Failure Modes:
  - ### Single-customer dependence (concentration risk)
  - ### Overbuilding on leverage (balance-sheet fragility)

## NVIDIA (gaming graphics -> parallel compute platform -> AI infrastructure)
- Example: NVIDIA turned a component advantage (GPUs) into a platform advantage (CUDA + libraries + systems), then rode a regime shift (deep learning) where its platform became the default.
- History (very brief):
  Founded for PC graphics and won the gaming GPU category.
  Launched CUDA to make GPUs programmable (GPU -> compute platform).
  Grew in HPC; deep learning made GPUs central for training at scale.
  Expanded into full-stack data center systems (interconnect + networking + software) as AI demand exploded.
- Model pointers:
  Strategy (Power & Competition):
  - ### Platform moat (ecosystem lock-in)
  - ### Full-stack integration (sell the system, not the part)
  - ### Complementor flywheel (make others successful)
  - ### Bottleneck capture (own the scarce input)
  - ### Pick-and-shovel (second-order bet)
  - ### Commodity treadmill (moat must be operational)
  Mental Models (Toolbox):
  - ### Compounding (time as a multiplier)
  - ### Leverage (tools, code, capital, people, media)
  - ### Optionality and reversibility (one-way vs two-way doors)

## Google (search -> ads -> platforms -> infrastructure)
- Example: A superior product (search) became a distribution default, then monetized intent via auctions,
  then reinvested cash flow into infrastructure and adjacent platforms (Android/Chrome/YouTube).
- History (very brief):
  Started as a research-driven search engine with strong relevance ranking.
  Monetized via intent-driven ads (auction model) while keeping search UX high quality.
  Built/absorbed frontier AI research (Google Brain; DeepMind; foundational ML papers like Transformers).
  Showed capability leadership publicly (e.g., AlphaGo) before the LLM consumer-product wave.
  Faced a research-to-product gap when chat-style LLMs became the default UI for many users (OpenAI led mindshare).
  Responded by accelerating “ship” posture and integrating frontier models into products (Bard -> Gemini).
  TODO: verify timelines and the “regained momentum / share gains” claim with specific metrics you care about (usage, revenue, enterprise wins, mindshare).
  Scaled via massive infrastructure investment (data centers + internal platforms).
  Expanded distribution/control points via browser, mobile OS, and key acquisitions.
  Reorganized under Alphabet to separate bets and manage a portfolio.
- Model pointers:
  Strategy (Power & Competition):
  - ### Platform moat (ecosystem lock-in)
  - ### Complementor flywheel (make others successful)
  - ### Bottleneck capture (own the scarce input)
  - ### Legitimacy and narrative (power that people accept)
  - ### Intelligence and reconnaissance (reduce uncertainty)
  Mental Models (Toolbox):
  - ### Compounding (time as a multiplier)
  - ### Leverage (tools, code, capital, people, media)
  - ### Incentives (people respond to what is rewarded)
  - ### Proxies vs outcomes (process/metrics are tools; don't let them replace the goal)
  Common Failure Modes:
  - ### Managing to proxies (process/metrics over outcomes)
  - ### Premature optimization; local maxima
