# Practices

## Write to think (one-page memo; argument map)
- Example: One page: claim, evidence, risks, alternatives, decision. If you can't write it, you don't understand it.

## Steelman opposing views
- Example: Summarize the best version of the opposing argument, then respond to that version (not the weakest).

## Mindfulness micro-practice (portable attention training)
- Example: Between tasks, take 2 conscious breaths, label the current emotion,
  and return to the next action without rumination.
- Use: Turn ordinary actions into practice (walk, eat, wash dishes) by staying with sensory experience.
- Anchor: Breath awareness is a simple "return point" when the mind spirals.
- Scan: Notice body sensations, feelings, thoughts, and recurring patterns (four foundations style).
- Conflict tip: When angry, pause before sending the message; respond after the arousal drops.
- Source: Thich Nhat Hanh mindfulness teachings (TODO: verify best reference).

## De-escalate conflict (compassion + impermanence + conditions)
- Example: A teammate blames you in a meeting; instead of counterattacking,
  pause, lower arousal, then steer to causes and next steps.
- Compassion move: Assume pressure/fear is driving behavior; respond to the need, not the insult.
- Impermanence move: Treat today's conflict as transient; don't crystallize it into identity stories.
- Conditions move: Ask "what conditions produced this?" (process gaps, incentives, ambiguity),
  then fix conditions instead of trading blame.
- Language move: Replace "you did X" with "we saw X; what changed; what do we do next?"
- Source: Buddhist compassion + impermanence practices (TODO: add a canonical source).

## Prediction habit (make forecasts; track accuracy)
- Example: "Will this ship by Friday?" write a probability and later score it; improve calibration over time.

## Pre-mortem / pre-parade (reasons it fails / succeeds)
- Example: Pre-mortem: "It's 6 months later and it failed because..." list causes; design mitigations now.

## Checklists for recurring decisions
- Example: Before shipping: security review, rollback plan, metrics, oncall ownership, and documentation.

## Red-team / adversarial review
- Example: Ask someone to break your plan: "How could this be exploited/misused/go wrong in prod?"

## "Day 1" defense (customer obsession; skeptical of proxies; adopt external trends; high-velocity decisions)
- Example: Bezos' "Day 1" idea operationalizes anti-decline behaviors: stay close to customers, distrust proxies, embrace external change, and keep decisions fast (especially reversible ones).
