## How to read non-fiction books

Reading nonfiction critically means recognizing that no text is completely neutral.
Foster empowers readers to become *active interpreters*, capable of engaging with arguments, detecting bias, and deriving deeper insights from factual writing.

### 🛠️ Practical Tools Foster Recommends
- **Ask good questions**: What is the argument? Who benefits? What’s missing?
- **Be skeptical, not cynical**: Challenge the text without dismissing it outright.
- **Understand the “contract”**: What does the genre promise you as a reader? What does it expect?
- **Apply literary tools**: Use strategies from fiction analysis—like narrative structure, voice, and symbolism—when reading nonfiction.

### main points of the book

- **Nonfiction is Not “Just the Facts”**
  Nonfiction presents a version of reality filtered through a *narrator’s purpose, bias, and framing*.
  Authors choose what to include, what to omit, and how to structure the information.
  Always ask: *What is the author trying to accomplish?*

- **Every Author Has an Agenda**
  Whether overt or subtle, nonfiction reflects the author’s intentions, values, and worldview.
  Consider the *context* in which the author is writing (time period, culture, politics).

- **Genres Matter**
  Nonfiction comes in many forms: journalism, memoir, history, biography, science writing, essays, etc.
  Each genre has its own conventions and goals. Reading strategies should adapt accordingly.

- **Structure Shapes Meaning**
  How information is organized—chronologically, thematically, argumentatively—affects how readers interpret it.
  Look for patterns: cause and effect, problem-solution, compare and contrast, etc.

- **The Role of the Reader**
  Readers are not passive; they interact with the text.
  Use *critical thinking* to question the author's claims, evidence, and logic.
  Pay attention to what’s said—and *what’s left unsaid*.

- **Language and Rhetoric are Tools**
  Authors use rhetorical devices (ethos, pathos, logos), tone, diction, and metaphor even in nonfiction.
  Understanding these can reveal deeper meaning and intention.

- **Evaluate Evidence Carefully**
  Check sources, data reliability, and whether counterarguments are acknowledged.
  Ask: *Is the argument well-supported, or does it rely on emotion or authority alone?*

- **Bias and Perspective**
  All nonfiction contains some form of *subjectivity*—including in supposedly objective journalism.
  Be alert to framing, selection of facts, and what the author may be assuming the reader agrees with.

- **Reading Across Sources**
  To understand complex issues, compare multiple texts.
  Cross-referencing exposes blind spots, contradictions, or consensus.

- **Active Reading is Essential**
  Annotate, question, summarize, and reflect.
  Approach nonfiction with the same care as literature: seek underlying themes, assumptions, and implications.
