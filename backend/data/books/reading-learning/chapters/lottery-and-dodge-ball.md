# Lottery and Dodge Ball
Have you ever played the lottery?
It’s like playing dodgeball in a gym run by the universe’s least tender-minded substitute teacher. The balls are numbered. The teacher is smiling. The other kids have sponsorships.
Every time I play, I achieve perfection: I manage to avoid all the winning numbers with the grace of a frightened gazelle and the statistical discipline of a Swiss watch. I miss them all. Clean sweep. Flawless defeat. If there were trophies for losing, I’d have to rent storage.
And then I think about the alternative, which is worse. Much worse. Because there’s a special circle of existential hell reserved for the person who gets five numbers right and misses the last one—the big, smug, important ball that hits you in slow motion while a stadium of strangers watches your future evaporate.
That isn’t bad luck. That’s a personalized lesson. That’s the cosmos leaning in to whisper, “You were almost somebody.”
That kind of regret doesn’t just sit in your chest. It redecorates. It installs carpeting. It starts answering your email. You’ll wake up at 3:17 a.m. and your brain will lovingly replay the moment you were one digit away from becoming insufferable at family gatherings.
Can you live with that? Would you ever recover from PLSD—Post Lottery Syndrome Disorder, a condition characterized by compulsively checking receipts, seeing numbers in toast, and developing a spiritual relationship with the word “almost”?
Meanwhile, the lottery keeps humming along like a cheerful factory that manufactures hope from paper and then ships it to the landfill. The dodgeballs keep flying. Most of us keep ducking. Some of us call it strategy.
So it goes.
