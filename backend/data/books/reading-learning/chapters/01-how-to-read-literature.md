# Literature
## Key Points from /How to read literature like a professor/
### Every Trip Is a Quest
A character going somewhere usually represents a quest for self-knowledge, not just travel.
### Acts of Communion
Meals in literature symbolize unity, trust, or betrayal depending on how they're shared.
### Acts of Vampirism
Vampires often symbolize exploitation—older figures draining youth, innocence, or life from others.
### Now, Where Have I Seen Her Before?
All literature is interconnected. Writers borrow and allude to older works like Shakespeare, the Bible, or Greek myths.
### When in Doubt, It’s from Shakespeare…
Many texts echo Shakespeare's plots, lines, or characters to add depth and familiarity.
### …Or the Bible
Biblical allusions are common—authors often use them to enrich character or moral undertone.
### Myth as a Pattern
Greek, Roman, or other myths provide narrative structures that reappear across time.
### Weather Is Never Just Weather
Rain ` cleansing, rebirth, mystery; snow ` purity, death, etc. Weather sets symbolic mood.
### Violence
Symbolic, thematic, and sometimes allegorical—it usually means more than just pain.
### Symbols vs. Allegories
Symbols are flexible, multi-layered; allegories are fixed and direct (e.g., Animal Farm).
### It’s All About Sex (Except When It’s Not)
Sex often represents other ideas—freedom, submission, dominance, identity.
### If It’s Square, It’s a Sonnet
Knowing form (e.g., sonnets, quests, irony) helps unlock meaning.
### Geography Matters
Place influences plot and reflects psychological, social, or symbolic themes.
### Physical Marks and Disabilities
Scars and deformities often symbolize emotional or moral wounds.
### Blindness, Sight, and Illness
Literal blindness often signifies metaphorical insight (or lack of it).
### Don’t Read with Your Eyes
Understand characters within their historical and cultural context.
### Irony Trumps Everything
Irony subverts all previous interpretations; it creates surprise and depth.

## Reading Strategies Foster Encourages

- Look for patterns: Repetition or parallels in story structure signal deeper meanings.
  - “Have I seen this kind of story before?”
  - “Does this situation feel symbolic?”
  - Patterns repeat (quests, meals, weather, names, journeys), and the more you read, the more your brain will automatically recognize them.
- Focus on One or Two Tools at a Time
  Instead of juggling everything:
  - For one book, pay attention to symbolism (objects, colors, settings).
  - For the next, focus on myth or biblical references.
  - Then try spotting weather patterns or geography as psychology.
- Like training muscles — rotating “literary lenses” helps build fluency.
- Think symbolically: Objects, names, and actions often stand for more than themselves.
- Ask why now, why here: Setting and timing are rarely accidental.
- Contextualize: Literature reflects its era, so historical awareness sharpens understanding.
- Stay curious: Literature rewards those who probe beneath the surface.

The key is: you don’t try to remember everything at once.

Instead, think of reading like a detective game. You build your skills over time by noticing a few clues, following your curiosity, and making connections. Here's how to make it manageable:

- Rereading Is Part of the Game
Professors reread. Great books reward second looks. You might only notice the biblical allusion or the ironic geography after finishing the book — and that’s fine!

*Reading like a professor means developing a trained eye—seeing the invisible ink between the lines.*
