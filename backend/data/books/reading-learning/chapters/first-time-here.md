# First Time Here?
There’s a special little question people ask when you arrive somewhere, like you’re a package and they’re checking the label.
“First time here?”
It’s not even curiosity. It’s inventory.
And I always want to ask back, politely, because I was raised by wolves with manners: What gave it away? Was it my face? Was it the way I looked at a street sign like it had personally betrayed me? Was it the fact that I was standing still for three seconds, which in a city is basically a confession?
Maybe there’s something on me—some tag I missed. HELLO, I AM NEW. PLEASE SPEAK SLOWLY AND JUDGE ME.
If the place is truly awful, the question makes perfect sense. A town so miserable it should come with a warning label. A place nobody visits twice unless they’re lost, punished, or related to someone who refuses to die. In a place like that, asking “First time here?” is just probability. It’s math. It’s safe. It’s practically a weather report.
But when it’s somewhere nice—somewhere people actually return to—the question feels like a tiny punch in the ribs.
Because what they’re really asking is not whether it’s your first time. They’re asking whether you belong.
And if you say no—if you say, actually, it’s my fifth time—they don’t apologize. They don’t look shocked. They just let the information hang there, like a limp balloon at a party.
Your fifth time, and you still look like you don’t know what you’re doing.
So then the fun begins. Your brain becomes a courtroom. You become both defendant and jury. You start reviewing your own costume for errors.
Did I wear the wrong outfit? Did I stand wrong? Did I order coffee like an amateur? Did I look at the map too long, committing the mortal sin of needing directions in public?
Maybe I should have walked with more confidence. Maybe I should have pretended I was late to something important, like everyone else. Maybe I should have carried a tote bag with a local bookstore’s name on it, as a passport. Maybe I should have frowned more. People love a local frown. It says, I have seen things here, and none of them impressed me.
Of course, the joke is that nobody knows what they’re doing. Not really. They’re just moving fast enough that no one can tell. A great human trick: sprinting past our own confusion.
And the person asking “First time here?”—they’re not an expert. They’re not the mayor. They’re just someone trying to place you in a category so the world feels manageable. Humans love categories. We’d sort the stars if we could reach them.
Still, I hate the question. I hate it the way you hate a stranger calling you “buddy.” It’s too familiar, too sure of itself.
Because maybe it is my first time. Maybe I’m new. Maybe I’m allowed to be new. Maybe the world would be a lot kinder if we treated newness like a normal condition instead of a defect.
So yes. Sometimes it’s my first time here.
And sometimes it’s my fifth.
And apparently, either way, my face gives me away.
