## Beliz Trip
Most of our time in Belize we spent on a rented fishing boat, which is a fine way to discover that the ocean is blue, the sun is brutal, and you—yes, you—are a soft animal who can be turned into a headache with enough light.
People come to places like that and get a romantic hallucination. They think they are far from civilization. They are not far from civilization. They are far from shade. They are very close to sunburn. They are within kissing distance of dehydration, and dehydration is not a good kisser.
The first day at the dock we saw a small boat called Sweet Jenny.
If you are a Forrest Gump person, you know that name. You know the man who ran ahead of his fate and the woman who ran inside his heart, forever, like a splinter. It is a sweet story, if you like sweetness. If you have teeth.
But this Jenny was not the Hollywood one. This was a Mayan Jenny. The bow was tied with faded colored cords, like what you find after some seaside ceremony—leftovers from asking the gods for a favor and pretending you are not asking. The hull had hand-painted patterns, the lines thick and blunt, like somebody dipped an exhausted finger in paint and dragged it across the wood while still wearing last night. Next to that was a sticker, half peeled off, featuring a jaguar with a grin that did not mean friendliness. It meant, I am smiling because I have already decided what you are.
You look at a thing like that and you understand something in a flash, the way you understand a joke right after it hurts: here, the waves aren’t waves. They are the gods breathing. And “Sweet” isn’t a description. It’s manners. It’s someone saying excuse me while stepping on your foot.
The boat we rented had a tougher name.
Been there, done that.
Translated loosely, it meant: there is no place I haven’t been, no thing I haven’t done. Or, if you prefer the masculine bar stool version: no distance I haven’t conquered, no story I can’t top. I am legend. I am sea. I am the old gun, 老炮儿, the one who has seen it all and is bored by your surprise.
You could argue that it was arrogant to paint that on a boat. Then you saw the captain and realized it was simply accurate marketing.
How to describe him? In the old measuring system where a man might be said to be seven feet tall, he was seven feet tall. He was also seven feet wide. This was not exaggeration. It was geometry. He stood on the deck and the deck looked guilty, as though it had promised to support a normal human and now had to hold up a small building.
He gave off the feeling of Maui from Moana, the demigod with the grin and the muscles and the casual certainty that the world exists to be negotiated with. You didn’t have to ask this captain if he could take you out to sea. His entire body answered for him: of course. And if the sea disagrees, I will have a word with it.
Then he actually smiled. It was a simple smile, the kind that says the world can do whatever it wants, because it will still lose.
He said, “Sit back and relax.”
He said it like a command and like a blessing. Both at once. English does that sometimes. Or maybe men like that do.
There are bodies that keep boats steady. There are bodies that keep other men quiet. His did both. In Chinese you might say his presence could 镇邪—press down evil—like a pagoda pinning a river monster to the bottom. It sounds ridiculous until you are standing in the sun, slightly dizzy, on a floating object named after triumph, and you find yourself wanting a little superstition.
We left.
And then we left again, in our minds, because leaving is not a single event. Leaving is a series of small acceptances. You accept the smell of fuel. You accept the slap of water against wood. You accept the fact that the horizon is not interested in you. You accept that the sun is not your friend. You accept that you will never again feel as clean as you did before you began sweating.
The sea was blue, like it wanted to impress somebody. The sun was hard, like it had a job. We were dizzy, like we were learning something and didn’t know what it was yet.
We sat back. We relaxed. We tried, anyway.
Out there, the idea of “civilization” becomes a joke you tell yourself to feel brave. Civilization is what you imagine is behind you, back on land, with its menus and its phone signals and its air conditioning and its clean ice. But the truth is that civilization is just a thin film, like sunscreen, and you have to keep reapplying it or you burn.
We burned a little.
So it goes.
There is something honest about being on a boat with a ridiculous name. It doesn’t pretend you are embarking on a noble quest. It doesn’t flatter you. It says: people have done this before, and they will do it after you, and none of it will make you special. You are just another warm body in a hat, trying not to get turned into a lobster.
That should be depressing. Strangely, it can be calming.
Because if it has been done before, you don’t have to be a hero. You just have to be a person. You just have to drink water, hold on when the boat rocks, and laugh when the captain’s confidence makes the ocean seem negotiable.
I watched him stand there, wide as a myth, and I thought about all the ways humans try to rename fear into something manageable.
We call the ocean “blue” as if color is the main issue. We call the sun “bright” as if it is not a weapon. We call a boat “Sweet Jenny” as if sweetness can keep you afloat. We call another boat “Been there, done that” as if experience is armor.
Maybe it is.
Or maybe the armor is simply the ability to say, in a place where the waves are gods breathing and the jaguar is smiling because it has already judged you, “Sit back and relax.”
And then to go.
We went.
That was the whole thing.
That was enough.
