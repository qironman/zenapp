# 心得

## 当下的就是最美好的
过去心不可得未来心不可得
无所从来亦无所去，如来

## 要杀死那个胖子吗
AI is going to replace a lot of jobs. I’d like to think it will make human life much better in the long run. However, in the near term it will bring real pain to people who can’t catch up with the AI wave fast enough. We’re facing the dilemma: would you kill the fat man here? Would you stop the development of AI to save those who cannot keep up? One argument is that we have to—otherwise China will do it.

## 认识自己 明心见性
the journey of life is about discovering the self in you. many people are not clear who they were throughout their life. they borrow names, roles, and expectations—child, student, worker, lover, parent—and mistake these masks for the face underneath. they chase a version of themselves that will finally be “good enough,” yet the more they run, the more hollow it feels, because they are moving without knowing who is doing the moving.
to know yourself is not to collect flattering stories; it is to look directly, without defending, without performing. it is to notice what you want, what you fear, what you repeat, and what you avoid calling by its true name. it is to see the patterns that quietly govern your days: the impulse to please, the addiction to comparison, the habit of blaming, the craving to be seen. when you can watch these things arise, you stop being dragged by them. that is the beginning of freedom.
明心见性 is not a slogan; it is a practice. you return again and again to the present moment, to the breath, to the small honest feeling in the chest, to the thought that tries to dress itself up as truth. you ask: is this really me, or just my conditioning speaking? you learn the difference between the noise of the mind and the clarity that remains when the noise fades. and in that clarity, you don’t become someone new—you finally meet who has been here all along.

## Life is a series of decisions and trade-offs  
Life is basically choosing, again and again, what you’re willing to give up in order to get something else. The best “choice” is rarely perfect—it’s usually the best trade-off you can live with, which means getting clear on what matters more to you, not what sounds more correct on paper.

Long term vs short term: do you want relief now, or the life you’re building toward? Most short-term wins come with long-term costs, and most long-term gains demand short-term discomfort. Neither is automatically right—the question is which price you can afford to pay.

Logical thinking vs evolutionary instinct: logic tries to optimize, instinct tries to survive. Instinct will push you toward comfort, safety, belonging, and avoiding pain—even when those impulses are outdated for your current situation. Logic can help you see consequences, but it can also turn you cold or indecisive if you treat people like numbers.

sometimes the choice feels like that brutal question: do you “kill the fat man,” do you sacrifice one to save five? Real life doesn’t announce itself as a thought experiment, but the structure is similar: every decision saves something and harms something. The point isn’t to become heartless or heroic—it’s to understand your values, own the cost, and take responsibility for what you choose.
