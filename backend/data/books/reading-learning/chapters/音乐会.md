# Concert
I used to think a concert hall was a place built for listening.
Then I learned it is mostly a place built for looking.
You look at who gets the middle seat. You look at who gets shoved to the side. You look at whose self-respect the ushers fold up—crisp, efficient, like a linen napkin at a restaurant that charges you for water.
So it goes.
The local star in the center was one size smaller than on the poster. On the poster he was a national emergency. In person he was more like a luxury towel that somebody washed in the wrong temperature—shrunken, polite about it, still expensive.
He came out swinging. Big gestures. Heroic wind. Less “I will play you Beethoven” and more “I will fight the oxygen in this room and win.” He was not so much performing as attempting to wrestle the air into submission.
So it goes.
The big-name guy on his right was the opposite. An internal-martial-arts type. He sat there like a safe. A safe with feelings in it. A safe that ate the key and then looked at you as if you were rude to notice.
So it goes.
There is always a Chinese guy on stage. Always. He is responsible for the hammered dulcimer or some percussion that looks innocent until it speaks. When it rings out, Western audience members have a small private ceremony in their heads: Oh. How… Eastern.
The mallets and chopsticks are cousins. Same family tree. Same religion. Tapping, gripping, picking up tiny things, and proving to relatives that your hands are “nimble,” as if nimbleness were a moral virtue instead of a survival strategy at dinner.
Some peoples are good at silence. We are good at turning any object into a metronome. Give us a spoon, a table, a railing, an anxious thought—we will find the beat.
So it goes.
The triangle guy was there too. His job is to make a single “ding” at the exact moment the universe least wants it. It’s like adding subtitles to your embarrassment.
Every time I watch him lift that little metal wand, I feel like I’m watching fate raise its finger: Okay. Now it’s your turn to be inappropriate. Now you will clear your throat in the quiet part. Now you will drop your program like a dying bird.
Ding.
So it goes.
The woodwind player made me think of the old story about the man who joined the royal orchestra and pretended to play. He stood among the musicians, moving his hands like a loyal citizen, producing nothing but confidence. Everybody believed him because everybody wanted the group to be complete.
It’s not that this guy was bad. He was just wearing that expression I recognize from meetings: I am sincerely participating in the collective, and I am also not sure what, exactly, I am doing.
Haven’t we all “played woodwind” in certain conference rooms? We’ve all blown into something and hoped a meaningful sound would come out. Mostly what comes out is respectability.
So it goes.
In a concert, holding back a cough is harder than holding back pee.
Pee is an internal crisis. A private rebellion. Your body vs. your schedule.
There are worse things you could do, objectively. You could—quietly—wet your pants. That would disturb fewer people. The sound is minimal. The impact radius is small. The only casualty is your dignity and that one pair of trousers, which will carry the memory like a medal no one asked for.
Unless, of course, you ate garlic or lettuce stems or some other fragrant vegetable and now even your shame has a soundtrack.
So it goes.
Real cellists must have a special kind of brain. They need the kind of split-screen consciousness people used to call “two minds,” as if one mind weren’t enough trouble.
The left hand does that high-frequency vibrato—shaking like a devoted Parkinson’s impersonation. The right hand must pull the bow steady as a judge signing paperwork.
To tremble and be stable at the same time. It’s a superpower.
It is also the modern human condition: I am shaking inside, and I am functioning outside, and I am telling people, out loud, “I’m fine,” while my soul quietly knocks over a chair.
So it goes.
And then my brain did this thing brains do, this little betrayal, this cheap magic trick. Out of nowhere it tossed up an English sentence like the phone in the seat next to me had misfired and summoned a voice assistant from hell:
how did he discuss the symphony with the mentor? !!!
I don’t know who was asking. Some overachieving student still living in my ribs, probably. The one who believes art is a homework assignment and if you just talk hard enough you can “figure it out” and earn a grade.
But music is not always interested in being figured out. Sometimes it refuses. Sometimes it just makes you sit in the dark with strangers and participate in a carefully organized group exercise in self-doubt.
So it goes.
The conductor is an entirely different species of worker. He has to make everything big. A great conductor is also a dancer, a traffic cop, a priest, and a person trying to keep a roomful of fragile mammals from ruining a quiet moment with one wet human noise.
Every time he lifts his arms, it’s like he’s writing in the air:
Now feel something.
Now don’t cough.
Now remember someone you loved.
Now, please, for the love of God, stop unwrapping your candy like it’s a hostage negotiation.
Sure, his gestures can reflect the emotional shape of the piece.
They can also reflect, quite honestly, the condition of his lower back tonight.
In any case, he stands there like a man who has temporarily borrowed everyone’s breathing and is rationing it out with his wrists.
So it goes.
