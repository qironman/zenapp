# Breakthrough to 9 figures ($100M net worth)

## Define the target (constraint + ambition)
- Example: “$100M net worth in 10–15 years, with a $10M floor” is a different game than “maximize EV.”
- Target: $100M net worth (individual).
- Floor: $10M net worth (define whether this is a terminal floor, or a floor at all times after you reach it).
- Timeline: 10–15 years.
- Measurement: define what counts in net worth (private equity, real estate, retirement accounts),
  and how you treat taxes and illiquidity.

## Required compounding (order-of-magnitude math)
- Example: Going from $10M -> $100M is a 10×.
- 10× in 10 years ≈ 26% CAGR; 10× in 15 years ≈ 17% CAGR.
- Implication: 9 figures usually requires concentrated ownership in something that scales,
  not only saving and diversifying.

## Two-phase framing (floor first, then upside)
- Example: Phase 1 aims to reach and stabilize the $10M floor; Phase 2 aims to 10× the surplus.
- Phase 1 (0 -> $10M): maximize skill, income, and ownership access; avoid unrecoverable mistakes.
- Phase 2 ($10M -> $100M): take bounded, high-upside bets backed by ownership and distribution.
- Practical: once you’re near $10M, start “ring-fencing” the floor (separate accounts/entities mentally or legally).

## Core principle: ownership + scalability
- Example: High income helps, but big wealth usually comes from owning a scalable asset.
- Typical scalable assets: equity in a business, a business itself, real estate portfolios,
  IP/software, and occasionally concentrated financial positions.
- Key shift: stop thinking only in wages; start thinking in equity and cash-flow claims.

## The "$10M floor + upside" barbell (anti-ruin, still convex)
- Example: Protect the floor capital, and take bounded upside bets with the surplus.
- Floor protection: lower fixed costs; build buffers; diversify the “floor” when you get close to it.
- Upside engine: concentrate your time and risk budget into a few high-upside paths you can influence.
- Rule: never fund upside with floor capital (no “one big bet” that can take you below $10M).

## Human-capital flywheel (skills -> leverage -> ownership)
- Example: Skill + reputation -> better roles/deal flow -> more learning -> repeat.
- Aim: become "top percentile" in a scarce, valuable capability (sales, engineering, trading, ops, design).
- Then convert skill into ownership: equity comp, revenue share, partnership, or your own business.
- Risk: staying purely salaried when your comp is capped and your output is scalable.

## 9-figure archetypes (how $100M often happens)
- Example: Most 9-figure outcomes are “one big asset” outcomes, not 100 small wins.
- Founder-operator: build a business with large equity ownership; hold or exit.
- Early equity: join very early in a breakout and keep meaningful ownership through growth.
- Buy-and-build: acquire a cash-flowing business, professionalize, roll-up, refinance, exit.
- Real asset development: development/assemblage with financing (higher variance; higher ruin risk).
- Capital allocator: investment/trading businesses with edge + scale (rare; highly selection-biased).

## Equity path (join winners early; negotiate ownership)
- Example: Early equity in a high-growth company can be more important than salary.
- Levers: join earlier, increase equity %, extend runway (low burn), avoid unnecessary dilution,
  and understand vesting/option terms.
- Hidden risk: concentration + illiquidity; plan for taxes and timing.

## Business path (small business -> scale -> hold or exit)
- Example: A boring business with distribution + pricing power can compound for decades.
- Mechanics: pick a wedge (niche), build distribution, standardize delivery,
  reinvest into capacity, then expand adjacencies.
- Moat options: brand/trust, switching costs, network effects, exclusive channels, operational excellence.

## Moat and category design (escape competition)
- Example: “Win a small category, then expand” beats “compete head-on in a red ocean.”
- Pick a wedge where you can be #1 (niche, geography, workflow, price point).
- Build defensibility before you scale spend: distribution, switching costs, brand/trust, data, integration.
- Beware substitutes: “different way to solve the problem” is still competition.

## Real estate path (leverage with guardrails)
- Example: Real estate can scale via financing, but leverage cuts both ways.
- Good pattern: match debt duration to asset duration; keep buffers for vacancies and rates.
- Ruin risks: overleverage, variable-rate exposure, local shocks, correlated downturns.

## "Lottery tickets" vs better convex bets
- Example: Lottery = huge upside but typically strongly negative expected value.
- Better convexity patterns:
  - Many small experiments (products, content, outreach) with fast feedback.
  - Options you create: skills + audience + distribution that enable future moves.
  - Deals with limited downside and meaningful upside (careful underwriting).
- If you buy lotteries, treat it as entertainment with a fixed budget, not a plan.

## Utility function (anti-ruin framing with a $10M floor)
- Example: In multiplicative worlds (wealth compounds), large drawdowns hurt more than equivalent gains help.
- Default stance: log-like utility (diminishing marginal utility) plus an explicit floor constraint.
- Operational version: maximize long-run growth while keeping the probability of ending below $10M very low.
- Practical rule: use fractional risk-taking (small bets), especially when outcomes are fat-tailed.

## Common traps (why people stall)
- Example: Lifestyle inflation raises the floor and kills optionality.
- High fixed costs: mortgages/cars/subscriptions that remove freedom to take upside bets.
- Vanity variance: chasing thrills (day-to-day noise) instead of building compounding engines.
- Hidden leverage: debt/derivatives/illiquidity that turns a drawdown into ruin.
