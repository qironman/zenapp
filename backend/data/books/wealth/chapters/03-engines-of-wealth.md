# Engines of wealth (reusable ideas)

## Ownership + leverage (people, capital, code, media)
- Example: A product team with code leverage can serve 1M users with the same headcount.
- People leverage: hiring, delegation, management systems.
- Capital leverage: financing assets that throw off cash flows (but mind ruin).
- Media leverage: distribution that scales faster than headcount.

## Distribution is a superpower
- Example: The best product with no channel loses to a decent product with a channel.
- Build channels: sales, partnerships, platforms, brands, networks.
- Control a chokepoint: logistics, shelf space, standards, default choices.

## Reinvestment and compounding
- Example: Reinvest profits into capacity and learning before extracting lifestyle consumption.
- Compound in assets: equity, skills, relationships, reputation.
- Compound in systems: processes that reduce marginal cost of growth.

## Information and trust as capital
- Example: Credit is priced trust; distribution partners bet on your reliability.
- Trust flywheel: keep promises -> get better terms -> grow -> keep promises.
- Information advantage: better measurement, faster feedback, better decisions.
