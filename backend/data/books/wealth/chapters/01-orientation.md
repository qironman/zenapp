# Orientation

## What "wealth" is (vs income)
- Example: Income pays bills; wealth is ownership of assets that can persist and compound.
- Wealth sources: businesses, real estate, IP, equity, claims on cash flows.
- Control matters: owning an asset with decision rights beats pure wage income.
- Time horizon: compounding needs time + survival.

## Non-negotiables (ethics, legality, risk)
- Example: A strategy that requires deception or illegality is fragile and often negative-sum long-term.
- Risk management: avoid ruin; protect downside before optimizing upside.
- Reputation and trust are assets; losing them is often irreversible.
