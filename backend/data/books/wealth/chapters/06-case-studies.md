# Case Studies (we will expand with your notes)

## Rockefeller (Standard Oil) — draft placeholder
- Example: TODO: add a concrete episode from the history you share.
- History (very brief): TODO: fill from notes; avoid guessing.
- Abstraction hypotheses (to verify from your notes):
  - Scale + cost advantage -> pricing power.
  - Control of logistics/distribution as bottleneck.
  - Standardization + reinvestment loops.
  - Consolidation / deal-making under a changing regulatory regime.
- Model pointers (from `thinking.md`):
  - ### Bottleneck capture (own the scarce input)
  - ### Commodity treadmill (moat must be operational)
  - ### Capital structure as strategy (financing is part of the product)
  - ### Legitimacy and narrative (power that people accept)

## Rothschild family (banking network) — draft placeholder
- Example: TODO: add a concrete episode from the history you share.
- History (very brief): TODO: fill from notes; avoid guessing.
- Abstraction hypotheses (to verify from your notes):
  - Trust + information networks as a moat.
  - Geographic diversification + redundancy (resilience).
  - Deal flow advantage via relationships and credibility.
  - Balance-sheet management under political risk and war risk.
- Model pointers (from `thinking.md`):
  - ### Intelligence and reconnaissance (reduce uncertainty)
  - ### Credible commitments and signaling (make promises believable)
  - ### Alliance and coalition strategy (borrow strength)
  - ### Capital structure as strategy (financing is part of the product)

## Inbox (figures to add next)
- Example: You share a short timeline; we extract patterns using the template above.
- TODO: Carnegie, Ford, Morgan, Walton, Bezos, Jobs, Gates, Buffett, Soros, Musk.
