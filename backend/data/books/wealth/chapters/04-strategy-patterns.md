# Strategy patterns (how fortunes get built)

## Roll-up / consolidation
- Example: Fragmented markets can be consolidated with standard processes and capital.
- Value driver: buy low, professionalize operations, raise margins, refinance.
- Common risks: integration failure, leverage blowups, regulatory scrutiny.

## Bottleneck capture (own the scarce input)
- Example: Control a scarce resource or capability that everyone needs.
- Inputs: energy, transport, compute, land, licensing, financing, compliance.

## Vertical integration and system control
- Example: Owning upstream + downstream can reduce costs and increase reliability.
- Tradeoff: complexity and capital intensity vs control and margin.

## Regulatory and political economy
- Example: Some wealth is built by navigating regulation better than rivals.
- Legitimacy: social license, relationships, compliance capacity.
- Moral caution: influence can become rent-seeking; track long-run backlash risk.

## Financial engineering (use with caution)
- Example: Refinance, securitize, and structure capital to accelerate growth.
- Good use: match financing duration to asset duration; build resilience.
- Bad use: borrow short to fund long in fragile markets; invite forced selling.
