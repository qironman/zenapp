# Method (how we will abstract from biographies)

## Biography -> pattern extraction (template)
- Example: For a figure, separate "what happened" from "what generalizes."
- Initial conditions: geography, class, networks, technology regime, regulation.
- Wedge: what they did first that created unfair advantage (skill, access, innovation).
- Bottleneck: what scarce thing they controlled (capital, distribution, supply, trust).
- Engine: how they scaled (reinvestment, leverage, standardization, roll-up, platform).
- Moat: why competitors could not copy fast enough.
- Narrative + legitimacy: how they earned permission to operate and expand.
- Counterfactual: what had to be true for the path to work (timing/regime shifts).
- Failure risks: where it could have broken (credit, politics, lawsuits, war, succession).

## Wealth equations (simple decompositions)
- Example: Wealth = (cash flow) × (multiple) × (ownership share).
- Increase cash flow: productivity, pricing power, scale, distribution.
- Increase multiple: durability, growth, defensibility, trust, optionality.
- Increase ownership: start early, negotiate well, avoid unnecessary dilution.
