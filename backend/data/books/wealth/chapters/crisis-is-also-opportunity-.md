# Crisis is also Opportunity 

## when market crashes, find the irrational dumping 
For example, look at the huge rout in the SaaS software sector right now. A lot of it is being justified by a simple story: “AI will replace them.” But before you accept that narrative, ask a more precise question: replace what, exactly, and for whom? There’s a big difference between AI making a product less valuable (real disruption) versus AI becoming a feature that strengthens the incumbent (overblown fear). When the market is panicking, it often sells these two cases the same way, and that’s where irrational dumping can create opportunity.
Start with the sanity check. What does the company actually do in the customer’s workflow? If it’s a system of record (billing, payroll, compliance, ERP, CRM data), AI rarely “replaces” it overnight because businesses don’t rip out infrastructure lightly. If it’s a thin layer that only produces content or simple analysis, then yes, AI could commoditize it quickly. In other words: the closer the product is to core data, integrations, permissions, and audit trails, the harder it is to displace. Also ask: is the company selling outcomes with a clear ROI (cost savings, revenue lift, risk reduction), or selling “nice-to-have” seats that get cut at the first budget review? In a downturn, the “nice-to-have” category gets dumped for good reasons, and you don’t want to mistake that for irrational selling.
Then examine moats that don’t show up in headlines. SaaS winners often have “boring” defenses: switching costs, workflow lock-in, compliance requirements, deep integrations, proprietary datasets, and ecosystems of partners and add-ons. AI can actually widen those moats if the vendor can embed AI into the workflow using unique customer data (with permissions) and deliver better automation than a generic chatbot can. A practical example: a vertical SaaS platform serving clinics, logistics firms, or construction companies may look expensive on a chart, but it owns industry-specific processes and data schemas that generic AI struggles to replicate without deep integration. Another example: security and governance software may get sold off with “AI disruption” headlines, even though regulatory pressure and risk management often increase demand for exactly those tools.
Now make the “irrational” part measurable. The market typically dumps SaaS in a crash through ETFs, index rebalancing, and broad risk-off behavior, not because each business suddenly became worthless. That’s when you look for mismatches between price action and business reality: stable or improving net revenue retention, improving gross margins, disciplined sales efficiency, and a credible path to durable free cash flow. If churn is creeping up, customer paybacks are getting worse, or growth is only purchased with heavy discounting, the sell-off may be rational. If fundamentals are holding and the stock is down purely on multiple compression, that’s where you lean in.
At what valuation should you consider buying? Don’t anchor to the old peak multiple; anchor to what you’re actually getting for the price today. For SaaS, common lenses include EV/ARR (or EV/revenue), free-cash-flow yield, and the “Rule of 40” (growth + FCF margin). In a fear-driven dump, high-quality names can get priced as if growth will collapse and margins will never materialize. If you can underwrite a reasonable base case—moderate growth, expanding margins, and durable retention—then a compressed EV/ARR or a rising FCF yield can be your margin of safety. Also separate “growth SaaS” from “cash SaaS”: a slower grower with strong recurring cash flow may deserve a different buy level than a fast grower still burning cash. Balance sheet matters too: net cash and long runway reduce the risk of dilution, which is often what turns a temporary panic into permanent damage for weaker companies.
Here’s a simple strategy for acting without trying to catch a falling knife. First, build a watchlist of 10–20 SaaS names you would be happy to own for 3–5 years, and categorize them by quality: “must-survive and compound” versus “needs perfect conditions.” Second, define your entry plan in tranches. Start small when valuation reaches your first “this is getting silly” level, add more if the fundamentals remain intact and the price gets even more irrational, and keep dry powder for true capitulation days. Third, insist on a checklist that protects you from value traps: (1) retention not collapsing, (2) unit economics not deteriorating, (3) clear product differentiation, (4) manageable customer concentration, (5) credible path to cash generation, and (6) no near-term refinancing or liquidity risk. Finally, look for confirmation catalysts that are boring but powerful: stabilization in churn, re-acceleration in pipeline, improved gross margin from infrastructure optimization, or management raising guidance after a conservative reset.
The key is to treat the AI fear as a hypothesis, not a verdict. In some SaaS categories—simple content creation, generic analytics dashboards, undifferentiated tools—AI can be a real replacement threat and the dumping may be justified. In others—deep workflow software, regulated systems, vertical platforms, security, and tools with proprietary data and integrations—the fear can be exaggerated, and the market can temporarily price strong businesses as if they’re obsolete. That’s the pocket you’re hunting: not “buy everything that crashed,” but “buy the businesses that are being sold for the wrong reason, at a price that bakes in an overly pessimistic future.”
